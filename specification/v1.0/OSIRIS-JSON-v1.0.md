## Preface
This document specifies the Open Standard for Infrastructure Resource Interchange Schema (OSIRIS), a JSON-based data format for describing infrastructure resources, their properties and their topological relationships in a vendor-neutral manner.

OSIRIS is intended to define a unified comprehensible schema to normalize data exported from diverse IT environments. OSIRIS is also designed to be extended to Operational Technology (OT) systems to support the inclusion of industrial infrastructure resources.

By decoupling the resource identity from its provider-specific implementation, OSIRIS enables a unified language format for cross-platform visibility, automated diagramming, and standardized auditing without requiring closed-source programs or vendor-specific parsers for every consumption tool.


### Intended Audience

This specification is intended for:

- **Developers** building visualization, documentation, inventory, CMDB, or management tools.
- **Platform Engineers** designing automation and infrastructure-as-code workflows.
- **Solution Architects** documenting multi-cloud and hybrid environments.
- **Compliance or Risk Teams** requiring consistent infrastructure evidence and auditing inputs.
